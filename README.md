Note: The given login credentials (Id: digitaltest1 / Password: Password1) hits "User Name and Password are already in use" error, I have closed browsers and restarted PC. Issue still occurs. Suspecting a bug in session validation in backend in different web browsers.
      However issue not reproducible in android mobile app.

I don't see video in main article, I assume the video element would be within the same div class='pane-content' for main article in homepage.
